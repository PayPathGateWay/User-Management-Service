# User Management Service (UMS)

## Overview

The **User Management System (UMS)** is designed to manage user data with an emphasis on security, scalability, and performance. It facilitates **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for user accounts, profiles, roles, and preferences in a secure, fast, and efficient manner. This system ensures that sensitive information like user credentials, personal data, and role-based permissions are managed with utmost care, providing APIs for seamless integration into larger systems.

### Key Features:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Management of user roles and permissions to control access to various resources or functionalities.
- **Profile Management:** User data such as preferences, contact information, and profile updates.
- **Password Management:** Secure password storage and handling, including hashing and reset workflows.
- **APIs for User Data Management:** RESTful APIs or GraphQL interfaces to manage user data across various platforms and services.
  
## Tech Stack
  - **.NET** with **C#** for building RESTful APIs.
  - **Redis** for session and cache management, improving response times.
  - **Bcrypt** or **Argon2** for password hashing.
  
- **Security:**
  - **HTTPS** for secure communication.
  - **Encryption** of sensitive data using AES or RSA encryption methods.
  - **Security middleware**: Helmet, CORS, and rate limiting to prevent unauthorized access and attacks like CSRF and XSS.

- **DevOps & Infrastructure:**
  - **Docker** for containerization, making the system scalable and platform-independent.
  - **CI/CD pipeline**: GitHub Actions or Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.
  - **Prometheus & Grafana** for monitoring and alerting system performance metrics.
  - **Nginx** for load balancing and reverse proxy.

## Scalability and Availability

The UMS is designed to scale efficiently:
- **Horizontal scaling**: Can handle thousands or even millions of user accounts by distributing the load across multiple servers using Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
- **Database scaling**: MongoDB sharding to distribute large datasets, optimizing for read-heavy or write-heavy loads.
- **Caching strategies**: Redis or Memcached to store session data and frequently accessed user data, reducing the load on the primary database.
- **API Rate Limiting**: To handle surges in traffic and prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

### Latency Considerations:
- **Optimized DB queries** and the use of **indexes** to speed up read/write operations.
- **CDN** for static content delivery to reduce latency in user profile loading.
- **Edge computing** for routing traffic to the nearest data center, reducing round-trip times.


## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Latency:
- **Profile Update API**: < 100ms for updating user profile data.
- **Role Management**: < 150ms for assigning/removing roles from users.

### Load Testing:
- Ability to handle **10,000 simultaneous user sessions**.
- Caching mechanisms reduce database queries by **30-50%**, improving system response times under heavy load.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites:
- **.NET** 8.0 (latest)
- **Docker** (for containerized environments)
- **Kubernetes**

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ums.git
   cd ums
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables in `.env` file:
   ```bash
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ums
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```


### Testing:
- Run unit tests using **Jest**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Conclusion

The User Management System (UMS) is a robust, scalable, and secure solution for handling user data and role-based access. Its flexible architecture allows for easy integration with other services, and it is designed to evolve with the future integration of machine learning and microservices.
